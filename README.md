## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
🏥: 
I am building Hemotracka, a comprehensive blood bank management system designed to connect blood donors with blood bank facilities. The system aims to streamline the donation process by allowing donors to schedule and manage their donation appointments efficiently. Hemotracka not only facilitates this connection but also ensures donors receive compensation for their contributions. Additionally, it provides donors with notifications about their next expected donation dates, helping them stay informed and engaged in the blood donation process. This platform enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of blood donation operations, benefiting both donors and blood banks.
